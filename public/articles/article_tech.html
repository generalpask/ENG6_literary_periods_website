<h2 class="title-1">Technology & Science</h2>
    Under the 20th century Technology and Science had significant changes because of the two big events that occurred. It was under the “World War One” and “World War Two”.

    <br>
    Technology has much improvements under war periods and especially the World Wars.
    Why that is the case is because it is then the governments are putting most of their state budget and resources on the military. Which include research on improving weapons, bombs, planes, etc. This can greatly accelerate technological development.
    Example radio, microwave and vehicles technology (cars) are some of many inventions that were first meant for military.

    <br>
    The technology resembles atom reactor which were invented some years before the bomb.
    That themself were also incredibly inventions which could use quantum physics to create high amount of energy.
    The bomb was invented and used by the Americans against Japan at the end of the World War ll. The bomb first hit hiroshima and short after another bomb were dropped at Nagasaki
    Which in total killed more than 150,000 people and gave many others severely radiation damage. It’s devastating power quickly was heard around the world and become popular as the super bomb.
