<h1>The Great Depression</h1>
<p>
    The Great Depression, 1929, was an event during the modernist period. It would see the world's biggest economies
    struggle to stay afloat. Almost the entire world would have unemployment rates and GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
    free-falling with the United States taking the biggest punch since it originated there. The GDP of the United
    States alone fell by almost half, from 103 to 55 billion dollars. In Britain the effects were also feelt, although
    the unemployment rate did not increase by as much as the United States 607%, it still took a large toll at 129%
    leading to 3,5 million people being unemployed. By the time the great depression started to have significant effect
    in 1931, the UK still had not fully recovered from the World War 1. Wholesale prices were increased by about 33%
    and foreign trade went down 60% which especially caused problems for New Zealand whose economy relies heavily on
    exports to the UK.

    The true causes of the Great Depression are unknown and all we have are theories about how it went down. There are
    usually two main theories in the argument, one is the Keynesian theory. The keynesian theory, named after British
    economist John Maynard Keynes, states that the depression was caused by lower “aggregate expenditures”. In simpler
    terms, it means that the value of goods were lower.
    <br> <br>
    The other theory is the Monetarist one, it says the depression was caused by a banking crisis which is said to have
    caused one third of the worlds banks to close. Because of the failure of the banks, the people wanted to have pull
    out their money and store it in their homes instead. The Federal Reserve was not producing enough money to combat
    the shortage that this contributed to.

<h3>The Gold Standard</h3>
<p>
    The gold standard means that a currencies worth is based on a fixed amount of gold. The british currency, the
    sterling was restored to using the gold standard in 1925. Many thought that he value became higher than it should
    have been and therefore industries became less competitive due to the low demand on exports.
    <br> <br>
    The gold standard was once again abandoned in 1931 which allowed the British economy to cut interest rates and more
    easily recover.
    <br> <br>
    The United Kingdom was able to recover faster than other countries of similar economic power due its economy not
    growing as exponentially, meaning that there was less room to fall as opposed to the United States which economy
    had been growing heavily earlier. 
    <br> <br>
    It would still take years until unemployment rates reached more stable numbers, in 1938 it was still at 1,8 million
    people.
