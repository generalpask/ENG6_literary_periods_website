<P>The culture drastically changed in the end of 19th century, For example music, from classic music in 19th century to more lively music in 20th century. The clothes doesn’t change very much. The thing that changed most was art. From the realistic painting in 19th century, in 20th century there was a revolution of art. Under the modernism period there was a birth of such styles as Cubism. Those painting wasn’t realistic. At the beginning there wasn’t popular but by the time people started to like them and wanted more of them.</p>w The Modernism period was a time of such an artist like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse or Piet Mondrian. They painting was very unusual what people was used to. But with the drastic changes of culture in the world at that time they were accepted.


History:
The biggest history events that happened in modernism was definitely both World Wars. The first one cause over 21 million casualties, but the second one was even more deadly, by caused over 81 million casualties. Most of them ( from 50 million to 55 million) are civilians, 21 million soldiers and over 5 million casualties.
The direct cause of WWI was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. After that the Germans demand requirements that Serbian couldn’t accept. This demand worsened relations between those countries and in the future made German attack Serbia. After the war started many countries decelerated war to each other.  In the end there was war between Central (German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria) and Allied (France, British Empire, Russia, Serbia, Belgium, Montenegro, Japan, Italy, USA, Romania, Portugal, Hejaz, China, Greece). The war invented many new technologies. After the war the situation in the world( mostly Europe) drastically changed. Disintegration of three empires: Germany, Austro-Hungary and Russia. The end of the war was also creation for the many countries: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929 called Yugoslavia). Only 21 years after the WWI the Second World War started. It started 1st September 1939 when German invaded Poland. Shortly after the invasion France and Great Britain declared war to Germany. So there we had two different alliances with different governments. The Axi( Germany, Japan, Italy) and Alliance(China, UK[ with all colonies] , France, and later USA and USSR). This was the first war in which there was soldiers fighting from every continent on earth.
After the war ended, another war started called Cold War. That was war between two super nations: Democratic USA, and Communist USSR.
