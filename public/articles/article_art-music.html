The early 20th century and almost the whole first half of it is symbolized by a creative and colorful development in the modern arts and in music. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol rose in popularity, and the music of composers Shostakovich, Strauss, Debussy, and others came to creation, all impacted by the fast cultural evolution, and by both of the World wars that began, climaxed and ended during that period.<br>
<br>
<b>Cubism</b><br>
An art style that was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and was coined by art critic Louis Vauxcelles, it includes the use of sharp angles and strong colors, with the bright and dark shades as well as geometric implementations often breaking down painted objects and persons into parts, more so than leaving them as a whole. Popular works include <i>Guernica</i> by Pablo Picasso and <i>Violin and Candlestick</i> by Georges Braque.<br>
<br>
<b>Dadaism</b><br>
Another rather unusual art style, the avant-garde-esque Dadaism was popular roughly around 1916-1923 and could easily be distinguished by what looked like newspaper cutouts plastered together and laid over old works, accompanied by other poor modifications. This style was a sort of protest against the integration of culture into the social hierarchy. It was also an expression of things such as anti-state and anti-bourgeois, but also just pure nonsense. Some even called it “anti-art”. A few well-known works are <i>L.H.O.O.Q.</i> by Marcel Duchamp, <i>ABCD</i> by Raoul Hausmann and <i>The Pillars of Society</i> by George Grosz.<br>
<br>
<b>Surrealism</b><br>
Surrealism rose during the early 1920’s, mainly being a shift from Dadaism during the chaos that was the First World War. One of the characteristics of Surrealism is the political split from Dadaism, with surrealists being mostly communists and dadaists anarchists. Pioneers such as Bretón, Dalí and others were supporters of the communist idea, with Dalí still embracing anarchy as a mark left on him since the Dadaism. The golden age of surrealism is often said to be post-World War II, since the chaos of the war muted a lot of cultural activity around the world. Despite this, artists such as Breton, Duchamp, Lucian Freud, and Paul Nash found time to experiment with surrealistic styles and techniques during the later years of the war, producing works that would later become famous. Some iconic surrealist works are <i>The Persistence of Memory</i> by Salvador Dalí, <i>La trahison des images</i> by René Magritte, and <i>La nostalgia dell'infinito</i> by Giorgio de Chirico.<br>

<b>Modernistic music</b><br>
Music saw a large shift in style progressing during the early 20th century and the both the world wars, composers plagued by the impact the war had but also thriving on the allied victories. The modern Impressionism was affected in the same way as cubism and other modernist art styles of its time; featuring more “color” and expression in the composition, evoking an emotional reaction in the listener. Impressionist works often included grand orchestration, harmony, unusual scales, and musical concepts that had only been just barely touched before. Two faces of this style were Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy, the latter of which composed the well-known piece <i>Clair de Lune</i>.<br>
