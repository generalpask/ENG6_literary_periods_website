    <br>
    Albert Einstein lived from 1879 to 1955 and is known as a one of the greatest scientist in the world. At the same time he is also seen as a big goofball with the crazy hair and with the tongue sticking out. He did some weird things like eating grasshoppers, used cigarettes from the ground. But in general he was not actually so crazy as some thinks he was.

    Under the year 1905 is when Albert Einstein truly shines. Many know him for coming up with a incredible ekvation but he did actually come up with totally 4 incredible papers.
    That changed the understanding of our universe. The fourth one was the ekvation that stated that mass and energy could be seen as the same thing.
    E = mcÂ² which means that Enegi = Mass*Speed of Light. This totally changed our understanding of the universe and thanks to that Albert Einstein is now know as one of the most brilliant scientist in history.
